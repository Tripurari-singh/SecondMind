# Second Mind

Second Mind is a modern MERN-stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application built with TypeScript. It allows users to securely store and manage personal memories such as YouTube links, Twitter posts, LinkedIn profiles, and custom tags â€” effectively creating a personal knowledge and content repository.

## Features

- **Full MERN stack** with TypeScript for strong typing and better developer experience
- **User Authentication & Authorization** using JWT for secure access
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete memories easily
- **Rich Memory Types**: Store URLs from YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and tag them
- **Responsive UI** built with React and modern CSS (or Tailwind, if you used it)
- **State Management** with React hooks or Redux (specify which one you use)
- **Backend API** built on Express.js with RESTful endpoints
- **MongoDB** as the database for scalable and flexible data storage
- **Error Handling** and validations for robust and secure application
- **TypeScript** support throughout frontend and backend for maintainability
- **Modular Code Structure** for easy scalability and maintainability
- **Environment Variables** for secure management of sensitive information
- **CORS** enabled to support frontend-backend communication
- **GitHub Actions / CI (optional)** to automate builds/tests (if implemented)
